 <h1 style="float:left;">Kiosk Kit</h1><span style="float:right;">December 11, 2011</span>
 <div id="spec" style="clear:both;line-height:150%;font-size:16px">
 I recently got a request to create another kiosk display like the one shown at <a href="https://www.smsmybus.com/motherfools/">Mother Fool's coffee house</a> 
 and <a href="https://sector67.org">Sector67</a>.
 Rather then build another one by hand, I went ahead and created a template that enables anyone to display a custom kiosk.
 <p>
 Very similar to the Google Gadget, there is a single URL that anyone can point their browser at to view real-time arrival estimates for any
 two stops in the Metro system. 
 <p>
 <a href=https://smsmybus.com/kiosk?s=0100,0161&d=WORK,HOME>https://smsmybus.com/kiosk?s=0100,0161&d=WORK,HOME</a>
 <p>
 The two, four digit numbers after the 's=' string in that URL indicate the stop IDs to display. The two direction labels are optional, but if you
 include them, order matters. They should correspond to the stops listed.
 <p>
 Enjoy!

 <h1 style="float:left;">API snags a giant new user</h1><span style="float:right;">September 10, 2011</span>
 <div id="spec" style="clear:both;line-height:150%;font-size:16px">
 Over a year ago, I smiled when I found SMSMyBus getting repurposed in the form of a kiosk at the <a href=https://www.motherfools.com/>Mother Fool's Coffeehouse</a>. 
 I <a href=http://www.gregtracy.com/when-pet-projects-grow-up-and-become-somethin>wrote then</a> about the personal satisfaction of seeing a pet project growing into something bigger.
 <p>
 Well, last week, that satisfaction blossomed into gratification when I learned that the <a href=https://www.wisc.edu/>University of Wisconsin</a> had included the SMSMyBus API in 
 the <a href=https://www.news.wisc.edu/19738>latest version of their app</a> released for the 2011 academic year. Now students using the app can get real time bus arrival estimates 
 throughout the city rather than relying on the fixed schedule right from their iPhone and Android devices.
 <p>
 Mostly because this is exactly the kind of application that can get the attention of the <a href=https://mymetrobus.com>Metro</a> and the <a href=http:s//cityofmadison.com/>City of Madison</a> as an example of what can be 
 accomplished if more public data becomes accessible in an easy to consume (programmable APIs) interface.
 <p>
 Super proud.

 <h1 style="float:left;">Metro Bus Kiosk</h1><span style="float:right;">April 23, 2011</span>
 <div id="spec" style="clear:both;line-height:150%;font-size:16px">
 The very first iteration of the API - never released - was a total hack and was not only hard coded for a handful
 of Metro stops. But it utilized inside knowledge of how the SMS app was built to make the data accessible. While it
 may have been a wart, it made the data available and produced the very first Metro bus kiosk at 
 <a href="https://www.motherfools.com/">Mother Fool's Coffehouse</a>.
 <p>
 When the real API was produced, the goal was to replace those legacy implementations with native API implementations.
 That's now been done and rolled out to all of the various businesses deploying a kiosk. You can see the Mother Fool's
 kiosk <a href="https://www.smsmybus.com/motherfools/">here</a> and the <a href="https://sector67.org">Sector67</a> kiosk <a href="https://www.smsmybus.com/sector67/">here</a>.
 <p>
 If you'd like to deploy your own, feel free to use these as a starting point. They are good examples for consuming
 the API in JavaScript. You can find the example code on the github repo - <a href="https://github.com/gtracy/smsmybus-dev">https://github.com/gtracy/smsmybus-dev</a>. Enjoy!

 One of the very first uses of the API was to create a Google Gadget that displays the arrival times right inside
 your Gmail window. But it never really worked quite right so it wasn't published. But now it's been cleaned up!
 <p>
 So with the help of a little XML, JavaScript and of course the API, you can now get bus arrival estimates for 
 your favorite Metro stops alongside your chat sessions and gmail folders! This post provides some instructions
 for adding the gadget.
 <p>
 <strong>1.</strong> Open up your gmail settings.
 <p>
 <strong>2.</strong> Select the 'Gadgets' tab.
 <p>
 <strong>3.</strong> Add the XML path of the gadget to the text field using the desired stop ID number in the URL path. For example, 
 for the eastbound stop outside of Trader Joe's, I would add, https://www.smsmybus.com/gadgets/metro/2749.xml
 <p>
 <br/>
 <img src="/img/gadget-instructions.png" alt="Gadget instructions image"/>
 <p>
 <br/>
 <p>
 To specify a different stop, just replace '2749' with your own four digit stop ID. And don't worry, you can always
 check other stops from inside the gadget once it loads.
 <p>
 That's it! Interested in changing this? I've posted the xml on github if you'd like to use it as a starting point -
